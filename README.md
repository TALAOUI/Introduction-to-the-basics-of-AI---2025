# Introduction to the basics of AI-2025

This module is a starting point for attendees who desire to learn the basics of artificial intelligence.
A wide range of methods is reviewed, including statistical analysis, data mining, decision trees, support vector machines, and shallow neural networks (also known as vanilla neural networks).

On the completion of this course, attendees are expected to be able to determine which approach is best-suited for their specific research (such as the selection of a supervised or unsupervised method). With the provided material, they are also expected to develop the skills necessary to assess the complexity of any given problem, allowing them to implement scaled and robust models.
